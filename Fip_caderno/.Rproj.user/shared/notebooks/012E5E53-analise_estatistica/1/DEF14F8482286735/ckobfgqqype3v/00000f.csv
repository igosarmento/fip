"1","Degrees-of-freedom method: kenward-roger 
"
"1","Results are given on the sqrt (not the response) scale. 
"
"1","Confidence level used: 0.95 
"
"1","Note: contrasts are still on the sqrt scale. Consider using
      regrid() if you want contrasts of back-transformed estimates.

"1","P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 6 estimates 
"
"1","significance level used: alpha = 0.05 
"
"1","NOTE: If two or more means share the same grouping symbol,
      then we cannot show them to be different.
      But we also did not show them to be the same.
