"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict nplants with trat (formula: nplants ~ trat). The model
explains a statistically significant and substantial proportion of variance (R2 = 0.61, F(1, 22) = 34.19, p < .001,
adj. R2 = 0.59). The model's intercept, corresponding to trat = 0, is at 95.75 (95% CI [89.63, 101.87], t(22) =
32.43, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of trat is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.76, 95% CI [-1.03, -0.49], t(22) = -5.85,
p < .001; Std. beta = -0.78, 95% CI [-1.06, -0.50])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence
Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
